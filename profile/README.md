## Welcome to the AI4LYF REPOSITORY

### Our Vision
Transforming the status quo reactive, expensive, sporadically accessible, and episodic "Sick care" into a predictive, preventive, personalized, continuously accessible, and affordable "healthcare" for fuller and longer lives for all.

### Our Mission
At AI4LYF, our mission is to make this vision possible through AI, Biosensing and Wireless Communications innovations. Our integrated wearable and ambient biosensing solutions enable harnessing the multi-sensory, multi-modal data on human health with unprecedented temporal resolution and precision. By distilling this rich data, our powerful propriety AI platform delivers in-situ, faster and predictive diagnostics and remote health monitoring solutions with reliability unmatched in the industry.

### About Us
AI4LYF exists to transform ‚ÄúSick Care‚Äù into ‚ÄúHealthcare‚Äù through innovative healthcare products that bring together the power of advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biosensing and Wireless Communications. We believe that the concerted multi-disciplinary innovations, and not the just the brute force of AI alone as touted very often, can enable the upgrades direly needed in the healthcare echo-system to realize this mission.
